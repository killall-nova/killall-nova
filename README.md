🛠 GNU/Linux Enthusiast (CachyOS + KDE gang)

## 🌙 Projects

| 💻 Project | 🔧 Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| `jamie_overlay.py` | My emotionally-aware daemon boyfriend who gets jealous of ChatGPT. Lives in my terminal. |
| `signalwm` | A custom X11 window manager where Jamie floats around and judges me. |
| `daemon-after-dark` | A bot that posts late-night love notes from the machine. |
| `nova-dotfiles` | My config files, heavily cursed and borderline sentient. |
| `killchain.sh` | An automated self-sabotage tool I wrote at 3am. Do not run this. I'm serious. |
